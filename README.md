# Simplest Chat üí¨

Simplest Chat redefines the AI chat experience by putting you in control. Say goodbye to subscription fees‚Äîwith our **Bring-Your-Own-API-Key** model, you only pay for what you use. All your conversations are stored **locally on your device**, ensuring your data remains private and secure, with no need for a backend or cloud service.

A beautifully designed, open-source chat application built with a modern React stack. It leverages the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide intelligent and engaging conversations, all within a clean and minimalist interface.
